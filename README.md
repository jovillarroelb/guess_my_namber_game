# Game: Guess my number?

This game is based on the first project of the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/.

It has basically the same game mechanics but added my personal touch to the refactoring and some CSS functionality to be a little more visually interesting.

Hope you like my work!

PS: This is the first JavaScript project I made ever! Comments will be very appreciated!
